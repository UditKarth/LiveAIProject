# CryptoMarket
Welcome to CryptoMarket, a decentralized marketplace prototype built on the Ethereum blockchain. This project leverages the power of blockchain technology to facilitate a secure and transparent environment for managing products and orders without the need for traditional server-based infrastructure.

## Features
*AI Powered Smart Contract Validation*: Trained on the following dataset (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/verified-smart-contracts), the AI assistant Jasper can audit and verify smart contracts to ensure safety in transactions. 

*Decentralized Marketplace*: Operate in a serverless environment with the Ethereum blockchain ensuring security and transparency.

*Product Management*: Seamlessly add, update, and browse products listed on the marketplace.

*Order Management*: Efficiently create and track orders, with all transactions securely recorded on the blockchain.

*Ethereum Integration*: Utilizes smart contracts for all marketplace transactions, ensuring trust and reliability.


## Usage
Adding Products: Navigate to the 'Add Product' section to list a new product on the marketplace.
Browsing Products: View available products on the 'Products' page.
Creating Orders: Purchase products by creating orders directly through the interface.
